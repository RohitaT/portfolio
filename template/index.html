                            <p>We started the group Brainstorming by thinking aloud about the features that would make sense to the product.This session brought about many good ideas which could be implemented.We decided on a Web Application which would be used for the pairing process and would also provide Phonocardiogram visualisations for data analysis of different patient's heart conditions.</p>
                            <h4>2. Prototyping</h4>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/sol1.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>After finalizing the design for the stethoscope, we started working on the interface. We created an information architecture of the application, and the flow of information with in the application.Due to limited time,we proceeded to create paper prototypes of the application screen.</p>
                            <h4>Our Proposed Solution</h4>
                            <p>1.Simple sign in with User-Id & Password <br/> 2.Doctor could choose to 'Host a session' or 'Join a session' <br/> 3.Device discovery- Pair the stethescope  <br/>4. If 'Host a session' the doctor needs to input his ID,the patient's ID and gender.The application screen would show the pulse rate ,blood pressure and the position of the patient during the current checkup <br/>5.If the user wants to "Join a session" then he needs to pair with the device required and "Enter Remote ID" to connect <br/>6.Chat feature available for the participants of a session ,to discuss the condition/diagnosis of the patient</p>

                            <p>This was my first Design Jam experience and I worked in a team of individuals with mixed background ,this taught me the difference between working in academic setting vs a professional team. The initial discussion did take more time than we expected, due to which our prototyping had to be rushed. I believe I will get better at managing time in the coming design Jams.</p>

                            <p>As a team of three we analysed the current Squibit mobile app interface and brainstormed about how we could create an effective yet simple design for the core purpose of anonymous incident reporting within organizations.We tried to think as a person who has faced a safety issue while working in a company and the kind of questions that would be required to answer.Asking the right questions was essential in this solution as it could impact the purpose of reporting effectively.Above were the questions we decided on asking the user in the reporting tool.</p>

                            <p>We created paper protoype of our design solution and kept it minimalistic ,as can be seen in the above images.So the flow of information in the mobile app would be as 1. Screen A -The user can enter 'What' happened in detail (text field) 2.Next it moves to Screen B -'When' so user can enter the date and time 3.Next Screen C - 'Who' user can enter the name and role of the person being reported , there is a feature to add more than one person too in this complaint 4.Next Screen D- 'How often' the user can select the frequency of the incident occurance 5.Next Screen E - 'Review Your Report' this feature allows the user to review her report/edit or add extra details to the incident reported before final submission.</p><br/>
                            <p>The report form would also have a progress status showing the number of questions answered from the total questions, to give the user an idea about the total questions that need to be answered.All these questions would be mandatory in order to ensure effective reporting of the incident.We also suggested a hamburger button on the user homepage which can show him a history of reports made and have an option for the user to retract any erroneous complaint made using Squibit</p><br/>

                            <p>I worked in a small team consisting of individuals with a similar background.The analysis of the mobile app and discussing the current Squibit solution with the client helped us understand the pros and cons of the existing solution that they had implemented.I also learnt about the psycology of a person reporting an issue and how maintaining anonymity is of prime importance in designing the solution in this case.</p><br/>

                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted"><strong>The Delonis Center Shelter Home in Ann Arbor (have maximum 75 beds) face serious problems of accommodating homeless people who are dumped from other jurisdictions ,in front of their doors. In the shelter conducted count it was found that the people at the overnight warming center were not from Washtenaw County. As revealed by the local officials this problem only seems to be getting worse, causing overcrowding issues for the Delonis Center</strong></p>
                            <h3>Interaction Design Process Followed</h3>
                            <h4>1.User Experience Research</h4>
                            <p>I interviewed the Director of Programs & Operations at the Delonis Center. At first I discussed the problem  with him and then he went on to explain me the reasons that cause overcrowding issue at the Center. Basically, the increase in the influx of homeless people from poorer areas like Wayne,Detroit and Southeast Michigan has posed challenges for the shelter home officials.</p>
                            <p>Currently the Delonis center can accommodate only 75 homeless people and when there is an increase in the number of people, they have the floors moped, mats laid on the floor, passages and sometime even in the office rooms.As per his analysis of the client data, there has been a significant rise in the number of homeless people dumped at their doorstep. The number of people turning up at the Delonis Center shelter home is unpredictable, and as of now the officials do not have a solution for accommodating large number of homeless during such an overcrowded situation.</p><br/>
                            <p> The situation gets worse during the winter months, as it is impossible for anyone to survive without a warming system.Hence they established the need of a solution in such a scenario which could be used to provide temporary accommodation /beds for homeless people.</p><br/>
                            <p>I also conducted an online volunteer survey of the residents of Ann Arbor to understand their awareness Hence, after this interview my problem statement became clearer and the scope reduced to support the efforts of the shelter home officials in managing the beds/temporary accommodation during overcrowding scenario at the Delonis Center. </p><br/>
                            <p>I also understood the feasibility of my suggested solutions with respect to my target audience;about homelessness, willingness to volunteer in some way at a shelter home and response to suggested solution of mobile/website application. Around 90 residents responded to my survey and I could analyze that majority were willing to volunteer at a shelter home, liked the solution of website/mobile application and were aware of the causes of homelessness. </p><br/>
                            <h4>2.Target Audience -Personas</h4>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/comm1.png" alt="">
                            <p>The paper prototype was user tested with two administration staff at the Delonis Center, and it was observed that they were a bit confused about how to close the video once it was clicked. They also clicked on ‘login as’ text thinking it was a button. For the ‘Post Requirements’ form the staff suggested that there should have been a text box also , which could be used to add more details to the requirement. Few of my icons were misleading the users and it did not work well in the process of prototype testing.</p><br/>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/goog1.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Our team of four analysed the problem with respect to our personal experiences with storing and forgetting perishable food items at home.We decided to have a mobile application solution  as it is easy to access on the go .It would help users to keep a track of the item's expiry date.We decided the solution to include the folowing<br/>
                               1.	Scan the bill which has code ( assume that expiry date is present on it) <br/>
                               2.	Notify user on the day of expiry<br/>
                               3.	Add on feature to suggest recipe related to items present in the scanned list.<br/>
                               4.	Predicted date for the next grocery shopping trip to be made.<br/>
                            </p>

                            <p>Due to time constraint we paper prototyped two screens of our design solution.<p>
                            <h4>4.User Testing</h4>
                            <p>We had a 15 min user test of paper prototype with the officials from Google conducting the UX Design Workshop .They provided us with feedback "This idea of multiple personas in your stakeholder pool is a fascinating thing. it reminded me of this story about a Finnish grocery store that developed a "slow" check out lane for the elderly. It was a roaring success. But what they didn't realize was there was a completely different stakeholder group that was positively impacted as well - the disabled. They both loved the slow lane for common and completely disconnect reasons at the same time."</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted"><strong>Design a solution to support the challenges while cooking for the visually impaired people</strong></p>
                             <h3>Design Process Followed</h3>
                             <h4>1.Target Audience</h4>
                             <p>Visually impaired people who use smart phones.</p>
                             <h4>2.Brainstorming</h4>
                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/chi1.jpg" alt="">
                             <p>We have focused on the problem of dealing with hot elements, food and determining doneness of the food while cooking. Presently visually impaired people have reported burning themselves or a fear of burning themselves as a result of not being able to see in the kitchen. </p>
                             <p>The above obstacles faced when cooking food without vision can be minimized with the help of an accessible solution which would empower the blind person by eliminating their dependency on a sighted person, making their experience of cooking enjoyable, and helping them save the unnecessary expenditure of eating out. Furthermore a strong personal conviction about the importance of cooking one’s own meal would motivate them to eat healthy.</p>
                             <h4>3.Prototyping</h4>
                             <p>	At a high-level, the solution is a ‘smart’ cooking knob that goes hand-in-hand with a phone application. The knob has an infrared thermometer embedded in it, and can be fitted on lids of most types of cooking utensils. This thermometer talks to the phone application that communicates the status of the food being cooked to the user. Since this is all in real-time, the user can perform the appropriate action on the food.</p>
                             <h5>Graphical representation of the designed solution</h5>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/chi2.png" alt="">
                             <p>. Cooking is an essential skill that is needed every day in adult life and will help them greatly in their independence and confidence. Keeping this in mind the SmartLid solution has been designed to make it easier, economical and safe for them to cook healthy food items .This solution would aid in boosting their self-assurance, help save money and reduce their reliance on others for cooking.</p>

                            <p>To formulate our personas, we created an affinity wall to pick out the most pervasive themes in our interviews: the type of people we interviewed, their unique reasons for choosing the School of Dentistry as their service provider, and the things that are most important to them.</p>
							<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/Affinity2.jpg" alt="">
							
							<h5>Key Findings </h5>
							<p>1.Most interviewees do not use the website repeatedly. <br/>
							   2.Some patients are unaware that the website exists.<br/>
							   3.The site does not include functions to track patients’ medical and payment records.<br/>
							   4.Many patients like the idea of scheduling appointments online, but the website does not have this function.
							   <br/>
							   5.Most patients think the website is difficult to navigate.<br/>
							   6.The three levels of treatment options are not clearly explained to patients.</p>
							<h5>Key Recommendations </h5>
							<p>1.Promote the website.<br/>
							   2.Build a portal for patients to track their dental records.<br/>
							   3.Allow patients to schedule online.<br/>
                               4.Redesign the user interface and create a search box.<br/>
                               5.Make treatment options obvious.</p>

							<h4>3.Personas and Scenarios</h4>

							<h5>Persona 1: Rick Hodges</h5>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/Per1.jpg" alt="">
                            <h5>Scenario 1: Rick Hodges</h5>
                            <p>Rick has taken up a plumbing contract with the University of Michigan LSA department and while he was fixing the pipes, he accidentally chipped his tooth. He is worried as he does not have any insurance. His friend suggests that he should go to the School of Dentistry to get his tooth fixed before it starts causing him pain. His friend explains that in his experience, the students at the school provide affordable, good quality dental services. He gets the phone number of the SOD from his friend and schedules a dental appointment for the next week. He receives the SOD Welcome packet in the mail two days before his scheduled appointment.<br/>

							Rick opens the Welcome packet and learns about the three different types of dental services provided by the SOD. Rick checked the website link that was provided in the SOD Welcome packet and discovered that they are able to help patients who do not have insurance.<br/>

							He reaches the SOD the next week and waits in the new patient check-in line. The SOD check-in clerk assigns him to one of the students, who conducts a free oral examination for Rick in order to recommend his proper treatment option: the undergraduate clinic. Rick is told that he will be receiving a call within two days from the dental student assigned to him in order to arrange the reconstruction of his chipped tooth. <br/>

							After experiencing the great and affordable service at the SOD , Rick feels satisfied and waits for the second appointment call from the dental student assigned to him. Rick is also confident that the overall cost of his treatment will be much cheaper than the private clinics.

							<h5>Persona 2: Jane Buchanan</h5>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/Per2.jpg" alt="">
                            <h5>Scenario 2: Jane Buchanan</h5>
                            <p>Jane, 65, is a retired Registered Nurse who is driving to her second visit for her periodontal disease at the U-M School of Dentistry Periodontics Clinic. Her primary dentist referred her to the U-M School of Dentistry Periodontics Clinic due to the high reputation of the graduate dentist students and her insurance coverage. Jane is happy about this recommendation because she likes the idea of playing an important role for the learning students. <br/>

							As Jane drives, she recalls her frustration in finding information about directions and parking at the SOD. She visited the University of Michigan once because her grandson began attending the University of Michigan for his undergraduate studies. However, she was not familiar with the SOD. Her primary dentist had written down the SOD phone number and website for her, but she misplaced the information. Unfortunately, she could not call her primary dentist because the office closed. Instead, she asked her grandson if he could use the Internet to find directions to SOD since she was not comfortable using a computer. He successfully finds the website and the information, and gives her the directions over the phone. <br/>

							After arriving at the SOD, she walks into the waiting room and waits for her graduate dentist student. As she is finishing up her visit, she jokingly says to her graduate dentist student that she never would have found the place had her grandson not used the website to look up directions for her. She then proceeds to ask him about where she needs to go to set up her next appointment for a cleaning. She is relieved to learn that she sets up her appointments directly with him for the remainder of her time at SOD. He walks her to the front desk, makes sure that her service is properly paid for, ensures that her parking ticket is validated, and points her in the right direction to leave the clinic.</p>

							<h5>Persona 3:Mike Zhao</h5>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="../static/img/portfolio/Per3.jpg" alt="">
                            <h5>Scenario 3 :Mike Zhao</h5>
                            <p>Mike has transferred to the University of Michigan's undergraduate engineering program after living in California his whole life. In California, he'd gone to the same dentist and doctor since he was a young child. His dad works as a software developer and his mom is a stay-at-home mom and has dedicated a lot of her time to taking care of Mike and scheduling his appointments.<br/>

							Mike has gone almost 8 months without seeing his dentist (who has called him and his mother multiple times to remind him of this fact). He tells his mom that he has just been "too busy" to schedule appointment, but in reality, he doesn't know how to do so. He talks to one of his friends who also has the Michigan student insurance and asks how to go about scheduling a checkup. His friend Facebook chats him the link to the School of Dentistry's patient webpage, and tells him that he should select the "Check-Up Clinic" on the right side of the page. He isn't sure what most of the content on the page is, and frankly finds it rather unappealing, but finds the link, and submits the Google form to request an appointment. <br/>

							The next day, Mike receives a phone call from the School of Dentistry's scheduling and call center, and they say that they have scheduled him for a checkup for the upcoming Thursday. Despite his initial impressions of the webpage, Mike is pleased with the quickness of the response. He asks for additional information from the clerk regarding where to go for his appointment, how to check in, and how to pay. She never mentions the website, but instead, just answers all of his questions over the phone. <br/>

							Mike arrives for his appointment, and follows the instructions exactly as the woman on the phone explained to do so: he went to the second floor, checked in at the desk, and took a seat. His undergraduate dental student and a hygienist came to get him, and he was pleased to see that they were both young and very casual with him. At the end of the visit, the undergraduate student gave him his phone number to use to set up future appointments, which Mike felt very positively about.</p>

                            <h5>Persona 4: Valeria Martinez</h5>

                            <h4>4.Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <p>We evaluated six selected comparator with our criteria to identify both good and bad functionality and
							 design. The idea behind this analysis is to find out what approaches work and do not work in competing sites, and then use this knowledge as a foundation for decisions in
							 redesigning the patient section of the SOD's website</p>

							<h5>Key Findings</h5>
							<p>1. Ineffective navigability and information architecture makes it harder to find
								  information on the SOD website in comparison to the competitors'.<br/>
							   2. The core functions that people desire from the website are difficult to access and
								are not as effectively executed as the competitors.<br/>
							   3. The SOD website lacks images and graphics on the site.<br/>
							   4. There is no ability for customers to interact with administration via internal email or messaging system on the SOD website.<br/>
							   5. Despite the importance of reputation expressed by our interviewees, the SOD patient website has very little promotional material of their services or achievements.</p>
							<h5>Recommendations</h5>
                            <p>1. Incorporate a navigation bar to allow users to easily access content, and build a better hierarchy of the most relevant/important information, group content accordingly.<br/>
							2. Redesign the homepage of the patients' section of the site or create a separate patient website to incorporate the core functions and information users identified as being most important.<br/>
							3. Include images and graphics on the site to increase visual appeal of website.<br/>
							4. Have an internal messaging system or internal email feature that allows
							customers to interact with SOD administration.<br/>
							5. Promote the world class services and achievements of the SOD.</p>

                         	<p class="item-intro text-muted"><strong> The AAACF wanted our team to study  the service design of their office front reception desk and provide recommendations, because they find staffing the desk cumbersome and challenging to productivity .They want to provide excellent service to their walk-in customers while also considering staff productivity and job satisfaction for the staff who currently perform the function. So as per the client, their current design seems to create a conflict between these two priorities. As a non-profit organization AAACF has budget constraints due to which it can’t afford a full time receptionist. In the past they have lost outstanding professional candidates for employment due to the fact that their job would include covering a shift at the front desk.</strong></p>

                            <h4>1. Client Background Research</h4>
                            <p>The Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation (AAACF) is a grant making organization in Washtenaw County, Michigan. They support non-profit agencies with grants made from a wide variety of gifted funds. AAACF offers a wide variety of flexible vehicles to donors in order to satisfy their benevolent desires. They offer donor advised funds, agency endowed funds, and donor designated funds, field of interest funds, and named unrestricted funds (GuideStar USA, 2016).</p>
                           
                            <h4>2. Analyse the Challenge Faced by the Client</h4>
                            <p>The challenge faced by Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation (AAACF) is with their current service desk design which requires three existing staff members to rotate in shifts to cover the reception desk. In order to accomplish this task, these staff members have to leave their regular work stations for several hours each day to sit at the reception desk. This is disruptive to getting their work done and the current staff who perform this job are unhappy with this duty. The productivity of the AAACF staff performing the duty at the reception desk, is negatively affected by the interruptions to their regular work as they are also required to move away from their regular work stations.</p><br/>
                            <p>Challenge of covering the reception desk increases when their employees are sick or on a break .During the time when someone leaves employment, the period that their position is vacant creates a greater burden on the remaining staff to cover the desk for longer hours. Furthermore during the busiest operational hours, the front desk coverage gets more difficult.</p>
